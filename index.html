                At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no 
                declaration of love more apparent than building a marble 
                masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to 
                travel than seeing its magnificence up close.

                After all, this is art. Built in Agra, <link rel="stylesheet" href="india.css"> between 1631 and 
                1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s the perfect 
                opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help 
                visitors prepare for their Taj Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a 
                little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – 
                from Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to 
                cover all the bases.

                That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its 
               own when discussing the Taj Mahal.

               Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not 
               thousands) of people. These include Indian men, women 
               and children who may ask to take photos with you.

               To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, 
               consider taking a group tour. Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from 8-day Golden Triangle tours 
               (now with solo-only departures!) to 15-day trips dedicated to food,
                to 19-day trips combining the highlights of India and Nepal.

                    The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally prepared, 
                    you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…

                    Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.
                    You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:
